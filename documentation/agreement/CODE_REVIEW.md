Code Review
===============================
[Back to Team Agreement](README.md)

- Don't expect all PRs to get merged
- Need a +1
  - +1 means you've looked over the code
- Check CONTRIBUTING.MD for additional requirements
- Address/Respond to all comments
- Try to complete your review within a day

- Testing:
  - QA +1 / +10 can be performed by anyone, and should include comprehensive notes of testing steps taken. These notes should also be pasted to the associated Jira ticket for thoroughness of paper trail.
  - [Appropriate tests](https://w-dev-blog.appspot.com/posts/2015/12/07/what-kind-of-test-is-that/index.html) should be included as part of a code change. Any exceptions to this need to be justified and documented on the PR.

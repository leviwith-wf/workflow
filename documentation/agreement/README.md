### Change process

- Make a PR
- Ask for discussion
- Open PRs will be discussed at Retro for closing

### Existing Parking Lot

- PR template should have room to BE DESCRIPTIVE
- Branching strategy. Master has to always be releasable. 
- Contract testing in order to address dependent services
- Ping each other when weâ€™re deploying something that might break something else
- What even are stories?
- Standup rules. Some people want to dump the JIRA board from the standup.
- IS it scottsfam or AZfam?
- JIRA Columns and workflow

#### Code Standards

  - Commit comments should have a ticket number on them
  - Each repo has a CONTRIBUTING.md
  - Checkstyle. Possibly belongs in Contributing.
  - Testing requirements should be documented in the repo

Release Process
===============================
[Back to Team Agreement](README.md)

- Use MARV to create release PRs
- Use MARV to message relevant hipchat rooms when a Release PR is created
- Ensure that release PRs only contain version changes
- All repositories should use pipelines (except the ones that can't)
- Use [Semver](https://semver.org/)
- It's too early to determine a release cadence, but continuous deployment is the goal we're working towards
